# Privacy Policy for HyperConverter

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## TL;DR

**HyperConverter collects zero data. Everything happens locally in your browser. Your conversions, browsing history, and personal information never leave your device.**

---

## What Data We Collect

**None.**

HyperConverter is built with privacy as a core principle:

- ❌ No conversion tracking
- ❌ No browsing history
- ❌ No usage statistics
- ❌ No personal information
- ❌ No cookies
- ❌ No analytics
- ❌ No external servers

## How It Works

When you hover over a measurement on a webpage:

1. HyperConverter detects the unit (e.g., "10 inches")
2. Converts it instantly using local calculations
3. Displays the result in a tooltip
4. That's it. Nothing is recorded, stored, or transmitted.

## What Gets Stored Locally

The only data stored is your **personal preferences**, saved locally in your browser:

- Which websites you've enabled/disabled the extension on
- Your conversion preferences (if we add customization options in the future)

This data:
- Stays on your device
- Syncs across your Chrome browsers if you're signed into Chrome (via Chrome's built-in sync)
- Never leaves your Google account
- Can be cleared by uninstalling the extension

## Third-Party Services

**We use none.**

No Google Analytics. No tracking pixels. No external APIs. HyperConverter runs entirely offline once installed.

## Permissions Explained

HyperConverter requests minimal permissions:

- **Access to webpage content:** To detect measurements and show tooltips
- **Storage permission:** To save your enable/disable preferences locally

We only request what's absolutely necessary for the extension to function.

## Children's Privacy

HyperConverter is safe for all ages. Since we collect no data, there are no privacy concerns for children.

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change how HyperConverter handles data, we'll update this policy and notify users through the Chrome Web Store listing. Major changes would require your approval through the extension update process.

**Bottom Line:** HyperConverter is designed to respect your privacy completely. What happens in your browser stays in your browser.
